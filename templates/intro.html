                <h2>What is Diabetes</h2>
                <p>
                    Diabetes is a chronic condition where your body struggles to regulate blood sugar. Left unchecked, 
                    it can lead to serious health issues like heart disease, vision loss, and kidney problems. Early 
                    detection is key. With this survey, it can start with just answering questions.

                <h2>Why Screening Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Many people with diabetes don't know they have it—symptoms can be silent at first. Early screening 
                    helps catch risks before they become serious, allowing for timely lifestyle changes or medical care.
