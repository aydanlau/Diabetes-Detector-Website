                <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
                <p>
                    Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. 
                    Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (glucose) and released into your bloodstream. 
                    When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a 
                    key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin it 
                    makes as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, 
                    too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, 
                    such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.

                <h2>How This Assessment Can Help</h2>
                <p>
                    This diabetes risk assessment tool uses machine learning to analyze various health factors and 
                    lifestyle choices to estimate your risk of developing diabetes. By answering a series of questions 
                    about your health, lifestyle, and demographics, you can get an initial assessment of your diabetes risk.
                </p>
                <p>The assessment evaluates factors such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blood pressure and cholesterol levels</li>
                    <li>Body Mass Index (BMI)</li>
                    <li>Physical activity and exercise habits</li>
                    <li>Diet and nutrition</li>
                    <li>Smoking and alcohol consumption</li>
                    <li>Overall health status</li>
                    <li>Age, gender, and other demographic factors</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Based on your responses, you'll receive a personalized risk assessment that can help you understand 
                    whether you should consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation.
